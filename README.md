# LeatherImageDS (LDSR)

LeatherImageDataset (LDSR) consists of leather images of 2 categories, Good Quality and Defect Quality.

A total of 29716 images are available in the dataset, out of which 16264 are Good Quality Leather 13452 are Defect Quality Leather. These images are generated from an original dataset of 428 images belonging to Good Quality Leather and 354 images belonging to Defect Quality Leather, through the use of multiple image augmentation techniques. The details of the augmentation techniques are explained in brief in the PDF document.

The Python code that is used to perform the augmentation techniques on the original dataset is also available in the repository.

The dataset is highly useful for leather defect detection and classification, quality marking, product screening, etc which are of high importance in industrial cases.
